For this project I wanted to delve into Chamber, a character from the first-person-shooter game, Valorant. The picture of him is front and center to capture the viewer's attention and let people know who this page is about. The image dynamically changes with the window until it reaches its original maximum size. I also chose a simple tan color pallete to match Chamber's color scheme. Still, I maintain a simple design. 

I divided the content into 2 sections - the lore, which is essentially background information, and reasons why I believe he is popular (some of which includes why I like him). For the latter section I came up with 5 reasons and inserted a gif as a visual reference for something that people may be unfamiliar with seeing. 

To finish off my web page, I included a link to the valorant wiki that had his voicelines should the viewer be more interested in what the agent sounds like or if they would like to explore more about the character.
