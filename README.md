# Portfolio Page
This final project showcases my favorite coding projects that I have completed through freeCodeCamp. I open it up with just my name and a simple motto so that there is a clean and minimal look at the start.

## Choosing Projects
I limited it to 2 per certification I've earned. So six in total are displayed and will link to the code. There is an image preview so the viewer gets a general idea of what it should look like.

## Other Sections
There is an about me with a short couple paragraphs explaining my background and where I am at in my coding career. Finally at the bottom there's links to my github and freeCodeCamp profile should the viewer be interested in more of my work. My email in the footer allows anyone to directly contact me.
