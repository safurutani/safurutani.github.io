        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hi there! I am a former pre-veterinarian student who has found their passion for coding. While I graduated with a Bachelor's in Animal Science, I decided to switch career paths to one that is more stimulating for me. The kind of logical thinking and problem solving within the field of computer science better suits my way of thinking. Also, why not increase my screen time from the amount I already have from playing video games?<br><br>I want to learn it all, and freeCodeCamp has helped me acquire such knowledge. So far I have completed the responsive web design, data analysis, and scientific computing certifications (whilst having a blast). Both frontend development and software development are appealing to me, so I have not yet limited myself to picking just one path. I'm excited to share with you the projects I have completed thus far! So why don't you stay a while and take a look?</p>
